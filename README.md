# MicroService Project
 Project to build out a variety of interconnected microservices

 Development Stages | Description
| :--- | :---
Project Management Staging | Setup project management tools for agile development
DevOPs Initial CI/CD Pipeline | Create blank template CI/CD local Jenkins Agent pipeline
Brainstorm  | Conduct research on interesting services that are feasible to implement
Voting  | Decide on a single microservice with a backend service that can be implemented, start small and work upwards towards a fleshed out API
API Design Stage 1 | Draft up minimal required API endpoints
API Security Spike | Research security practices to secure API endpoints
API Proof of Concept (POC) | POSTMAN Collection of API Design Stage 1
Service Application Design | Design Infrastructure and DevOPs to host microservice
Develop Microservice Application | Create a POC microservice application that runs in Docker container
DevOPs Deployment Spike | Research effort to run microservice on the cloud and scripts/commands to deploy microservice locally
DevOPs Pipeline Spike | Research free open source tools for Jenkins Pipeline to improve code quality & Configuring Artifactory Repository with GitHub
SDK Spike | Research effort to develop a TypeScript SDK to use microservice's API

## DevOPs Requirements:
* CI - Continuous Integration Pipeline should improve code quality provide transparent code coverage, and automate versioning for deployment
* CD - Continuous Deployment Pipeline should automate deployments to any CLOUD environments running the microservice and manage packages/artifacts
